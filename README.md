**Tilemap** is a [**Playdate**](https://play.date) **toybox** which is a drop-in replacement for `playdate.graphics.tilemap` with new features.

You can add it to your **Playdate** project by installing [**toybox.py**](https://toyboxpy.io), going to your project folder in a Terminal window and typing:

```console
toybox add DidierMalenfant/Tilemap
toybox update
```

Then, if your code is in the `source` folder, just import the following:

```lua
import '../toyboxes/toyboxes.lua'
```

This **toybox** contains **Lua** toys for you to play with.

‼️ This **toybox** is in active development, the API can change at any time... ‼️
